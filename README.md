# POSSA (Proof of Selected Service Accomplishment)

### The problem
We all know mining requires lots of computing power and energy to create valid hashes, and though it works really well, maybe better than proof of stake, it's still questionable whether mining is worth the environmental damage it ought to be causing.

### Why do we mine?
As far as I understand, the goal of mining is just to prove that a required amount of work has been done, which is needed because otherwise someone could just flood the network with invalid blocks, kind of like a DDOS attack.

### A solution?
Let people put bountied tasks on the network. Such tasks will have a given set of requirements and a defined way to verify completion, repeatable by everyone.
If the task was completed and verified, the bounty can be claimed by producing valid blocks.

### What are the benefits?
- A marketplace is realised, embedded within the blockchain/currency.
- Valuable work can be performed instead of creating valid hashes.
- Transaction fees could be removed entirely, thus promoting people to actually spend their currency instead of using it as stocks.

# Help with the development!
I've created a discord where we can collaborate to refine, and hopefully develop such a system. We might even create a new crypto in the process!
